# Crewboard

Crewboard is a web app that helps student teams (uni + high school) turn a project brief into a plan, a task board, and a rhythm.

## MVP (v0)
- Create a project “room”
- Invite members via link/email
- Upload brief as PDF (or paste text)
- LLM-assisted: brief → milestones + tasks (with owners + acceptance criteria)
- Task board (Kanban)
- Async standups: daily check-in → team summary + task updates

## Stack (proposed)
- Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript
- Supabase (Auth + Postgres + Storage)
- Tailwind
- OpenAI (LLM)
- GitHub Actions CI

## Docs
- Planning: `docs/PLAN.md`
- Schema: `docs/SCHEMA.md`
- API/Routes: `docs/ROUTES.md`

## Local dev
TBD after planning is locked.
